PC and IR
</H3>
</DT>
<DD>
    Two important hidden registers are the <B>PC</B>, which is short for
the <B>program counter</B> and <B>IR</B>, which is short for the instruction
register.
<H4>
PC, the Program Counter
</H4>
   PC is a 32-bit hidden register.
<P>
   The PC is a poor description for what a PC does.  It does not count
programs, and is not really a counter at all.  The PC holds the
<I>address</I> of the current instruction being executed.  At times,
the PC may hold the address plus 4, attempting to anticipate the
"next" instruction to be executed.
<P>
   Recall that, in MIPS, instructions are 4 bytes long and thus use
up 4 consecutive memory locations.   Since instructions are words, they
must be stored at word-aligned addresses, i.e., at addresses divisible
by 4.
<P>
   If you inspect the low two bits of the PC (i.e., <B>PC<sub>1..0</sub></B>),
you'd notice that they always end in 00.
<P>
   Unless a branch or jump occurs, PC is updated to PC + 4, the address
of the next instruction in memory.   Notice that the next instruction
in memory is <I>not</I> the same as the next instruction to be executed.
It's possible for the next instruction to be executed to be some other
instruction besides PC + 4.

<H4>
IR, the Instruction Register
</H4>   
   IR is a 32-bit hidden register.
<P>
   At least, IR has a reasonable name.  This register actually stores
an instruction.   In particular, it stores the instruction given by PC.
<P>
   By storing an instruction in a register, we can use the output of
the register to control other parts of the CPU, so the instruction can
be executed.
</DD>

<H3>
How PC and IR are used in conjunction with MAR and MDR
</H3>
</DT>
<DD>
   Usually, PC holds the address of the current instruction.  However,
once that instruction has completed, then PC is updated with a new value,
for the next instruction.   At that point, IR still holds the old instruction,
and we need to go get the new instruction.
<P>
   Where is this new instruction?  It's in memory.  We need to get that
instruction out of memory, and bring it to the CPU where the CPU can
execute it.
<P>
   To get the new PC to memory, we need to get its address to the address
bus.  However, the only register we have that can access the address bus
is the MAR.
<P>
   So, we need the datapath of the CPU to connect the output of the PC
to the input of the MAR.  That's not too hard.  We simply attach a bus
from the output of the PC to the input of the MAR, and we're done.
<P>
   What about the IR?   The IR contains a new instruction.  That
instruction is going to be provided by memory, and placed onto the
data bus.  The CPU then reads the instruction off the data bus
and places it in the MDR.
<P>
    We need one of the outputs of the MDR to go the inputs of the IR.
The other output is going to be used to store data into one of the
user-visible registers.  However, we'll deal with that later.
</DD>

A Modified Diagram
</H3>
</DT>
<DD>
    We can now modify the diagram from the last set of notes to include
the PC and the IR.
<P>

<P>
   So <B>PC</B> feeds directly to <B>MAR</B>.  We'll need to add a MUX
later on to the diagram, because the MAR can get its address from either
the PC (when it needs to fetch an instruction from memory) or
from some other location to be specified later (when it needs to
fetch data from memory).
<P>
   The output of MDR goes to IR.  The input to MDR can either come from
some place in the CPU (we just label it ???) to indicate this is data
being sent to the data bus, or it can come from the data bus itself (when
we're doing a load operation).
<P>
    One way to understand this diagram is to draw it out yourself,
and see what you think as you draw it.  Sometimes, staring at a complicated
diagram doesn't give you as much insight as drawing it.
<P>
   Also think about where the information has to flow when you
are doing the following operations:
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI> Placing an instruction address from PC to MAR.
  <LI> Placing an data address to MAR from someplace to be specified
later (the diagram above doesn't allow you to do that--what needs to
be changed?)
  <LI> Loading data into the MDR from someplace to be specified later
  <LI> Loading data into the MDR from the data bus
  <LI> Sending the output of the MDR to the IR
  <LI> Sending the output of the MDR to someplace to be specified later
(the diagram above doesn't allow you to do that--what needs to
be changed?)
</UL>

Summary
</H3>
</DT>
<DD>
   The PC is used to store the address of the current instruction.  However,
as the program runs, the value of PC changes, and as it changes, we need
to get the instruction associated with it from memory and put it in
the IR.
<P>
    Both of these registers are 32-bits and both are "hidden".  That is,
they are not directly accessible by the assembly language programmer.
<P>
    PC is not a particularly good name.  It fails to describe its
purpose clearly, and can be confused for phrases "personal computer"
and "political correctness".  Nevertheless, for historical reasons, we
use the term PC to refer to the address of the instruction.
<P>
    PC and IR must interact with MAR and MDR because MAR and MDR are
the registers that lie between the CPU and the data and address bus.
Later on, we may decide to remove the MAR and/or the MAR for efficiency
reasons.
